<h1>About</h1>

<p>
	I am a MS student at <a href="https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/">Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory</a>,
	<a href="https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST School of Computing</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I am interested in hardware technologies, especially about lowering the cost and effort building
	new complex designs.

	<br />

	Currently I am building a high-level Hardware Description Language, which is designed to be easily
	programmable, offering an accessible platform without compromising on performance.
